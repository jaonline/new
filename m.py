I came across your Airbnb listing, {row['Title']}, and it looks fantastic! Youâ€™ve done an incredible job maintaining a {row['Rating']} star rating from {row['Reviews']} reviews.

The reason I'm emailing you is that I can help improve your Airbnb ranking and manage your pricing effectively.
I have a tool that can extract SEO keywords to boost your ranking. It also scrapes competitor prices, enabling you to adjust your pricing strategically and stay ahead in the market.

Would you like me to show you how it works?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
